## Introduction

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are the foundation of many modern machine learning applications. This project provides an educational implementation of a fully functional DNN to help users understand its inner workings, including:
- Initialization of weights and biases
- Matrix operations for forward propagation
- Computing gradients for backpropagation
- Updating parameters using optimization algorithms

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or later
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualizations)

Install the dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
Usage
1. Clone the Repository
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deep-neural-network-from-scratch.git
   cd deep-neural-network-from-scratch
2. Run the Code
Run the script with a sample dataset:
python b22ee057_b22ee094.py
```
# Customize
Modify the network parameters such as the number of layers, neurons per layer, or learning rate in the code to experiment with different configurations.
Code Structure
b22ee057_b22ee094.py: Main script containing the neural network implementation.
utils.py: Helper functions for data preprocessing and evaluation (if applicable).
datasets/: Sample datasets for training and testing (optional).
Results
Training Accuracy: 100X%

Test Accuracy: 98%

### Confusion Matrix
Below is the confusion matrix generated after testing the model:
